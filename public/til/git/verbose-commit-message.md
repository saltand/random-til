# Verbose Commit Message

Git allows you to display a *diff* of the staged changes in the commit
message buffer. This gives you the opportunity to carefully craft your
commit message in a way that accurately describes the changes being
committed. To display the diff when committing:

```bash
$ git commit -v
```
