# Toggle Between Stories In Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a great tool for UI development,
especially in the React world. Storybook has a sidebar built in for
navigating between all your stories, with a mouse. You can also navigate
between them with just your keyboard.

Use `Cmd-Shift-←` and `Cmd-Shift-→` to move backward and forward through
your stories.

This even works when the navigation sidebar is hidden.
