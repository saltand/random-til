# Add Hotkeys For Specific Raycast Extensions

One of the main things I use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) for is its
built-in clipboard history extension. It's super handy when I've copied a Git
SHA or a URL or a bit of text several copies ago and I want to be able to refer
back to it. It keeps 7 days of clipboard history by default, so anything that I
remember copying is going to be there.

To get there, I have to trigger Raycast, which I usually open via Alfred (I
know, ðŸ˜…). Then I search for Clipboard History (or find it under recent
suggestions).

Raycast supports arbitrary hotkey bindings for triggering different extensions
and their features. So I can get to the Clipboard History in a single step --
e.g. with `Ctrl+Shift+V`.

From Raycast _Settings_, go to the _Extensions_ tab. Find _Clipboard History_
in the list and then click the _Record Hotkey_ input for it. I then type
`Ctrl+Shift+V` and I'm all set.
