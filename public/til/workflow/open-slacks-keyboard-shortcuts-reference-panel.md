# Open Slack's Keyboard Shortcuts Reference Panel

Slack has a ton of keyboard shortcuts, but you might only be familiar with
some of the more obvious ones. When I started using Slack, I quickly
discovered that `Cmd+}` and `Cmd+{` allow you to navigate forward and
backward through your different Slack workspaces.

But there is a whole world of Slack keyboard shortcuts that I didn't know
about. By hitting `Cmd+/` a Keyboard Shortcuts reference panel will be
toggled open. This lists all of the keyboard shortcuts you didn't know you
needed.
