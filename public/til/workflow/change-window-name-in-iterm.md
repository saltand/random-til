# Change Window Name In iTerm

By default, the name that appears in the top bar of the
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) window is the session name plus the job that
is running. This can be changed to some static value of your choosing.

To change this, hit `Cmd+i` and change the field labeled "Window Title".
