# Set Recurring Reminders In Slack

I usually just talk to my coworkers in Slack. There are also ways of talking
to slackbot. For instance, you can ask slackbot to remind you of things.
Here is the structure of that kind of request:

```
/remind [who] [what] [when]
```

I can use this to set a recurring reminder for myself.

```
/remind @jbranchaud Drink a beer at 5pm on Fridays
```

Slackbot assures me that my reminder has been noted.
