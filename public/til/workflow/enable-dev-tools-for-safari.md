# Enable Dev Tools For Safari

By default Safari's developer tools are hidden. To enable them, you need to go
into the _Advanced_ section of _Preferences_ and check the box at the bottom of
the screen that reads "Show Develop menu in menu bar."

This will give you access to all sorts of menu items like "Show web inspector"
and "Disable JavaScript".
