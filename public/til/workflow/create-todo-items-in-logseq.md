# Create Todo Items In Logseq

Having used GitHub flavored markdown and tools like Roam Research and Obsidian,
I'm used to being able to add interactive todo items to a document with square
brackets, like so:

```
- [ ] Do this
- [ ] Do that
```

This exact syntax doesn't work in Logseq, but I've figured out two ways of
adding todo items.

First, you can access the todo syntax with a forward slash command. Type `/`
and then start typing `TODO`. It will show up as a top result. Hit enter and
you'll have a fresh todo item that you can add a description to.

Second, as the above hints at, we can get right to the todo syntax by typing
one of `TODO`, `NOW`, or `LATER` in all caps followed by a description. For
example:

```
TODO Send out invoices
NOW Reply to those emails
LATER Schedule that meeting
```

These will render as checkable boxes marked as either `TODO`, `NOW`, or
`LATER`, until they are checked off.

You can also search for blocks that match one of these three categories.
