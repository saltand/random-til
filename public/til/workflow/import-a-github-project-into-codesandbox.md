# Import A Github Project Into CodeSandbox

A really fancy feature that [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) offers is
the ability to import a Github project. If you go to the [Create
Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/) page, you'll see some options including
_Import from Github_. From there, paste in the URL to a public github
repository and a matter of seconds your entire project will be synced into
a new CodeSandbox project.

I recently did this with a [create-react-app
project](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/jbranchaud/redux-little-router-example)
and CodeSandbox even knew how to recognize that it was a CRA app so that it
could run and display it in the web view.
