# Get URL For GitHub User Profile Photo

You can access your (or really any user's) profile photo by visiting the GitHub
profile URL with `.png` added on to the end.

So, my GitHub profile URL is:

```
https://github.com/jbranchaud
```

If I were to add `.png` on to that and visit it in my browser:

```
https://github.com/jbranchaud.png
```

I'd be redirected to the following URL:

```
https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/694063?v=4
```

This is the stable URL for my GitHub avatar. In the browser I will see the full
resolution image which I can download as needed.
