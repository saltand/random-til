# Temporarily Hide CleanShot X Capture Previews

The _capture previews_ that CleanShot X provides are a useful part of my
workflow. I often capture a screenshot or recording a bit in advance of needing
to add it as, say, an attachment. The preview icons float off to the right of
my screen, generally out of the way. As soon as I need them, I can annotate,
drag-n-drop, etc.

Sometimes, however, they do get in the way. But I'm not ready to dismiss them
and I don't want to save them off to some folder buried in my file system.

To temporarily slide the capture previews down off the screen, I can hit the
shortcut `Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+H`. The arrow at the butto of the screen can be clicked
to unhide them, or I can hit the same shortcut sequence to reveal them.
