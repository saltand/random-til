# Send A PDF To Your Kindle

I recently got a Kindle. I already have a bunch of PDF and ePub books on my
computer that I've bought over the years. I wanted to be able to read some of
those books on the Kindle. I found that there is a way to send these formats to
your Kindle via email.

There are a couple steps to get this working.

First, from the Amazon account that is tied to the Kindle device, open the
_Account_ dropdown and click _Devices. Any devices tied to your account will be
listed there. Navigate to the one you want to send to. Under the _Device
Summary_ with be a custom email address for that device. Something like
`youremail_abc123@kindle.com`.

That's the email you'll send the PDF or ePub attachment to.

Second, that Kindle email address will only receive and process documents from
a known, verified email address. Back on the _Devices_page, click on the
_Preferences_ tab. Under _Personal Document Preferences_ make sure that the
_Approved Personal Document Email List_ includes the email address you'll be
sending from. Add it if not.

Everything is set up. Now compose an email to that Kindle address, add the
attachment, and send. Give it 5 or so minutes to process and it should show up
on your device.

Additionally, you can go to the _Content_ tab and then to _Digital Content_ to
see what documents you have set and which devices have received them.
