# Make The Browser Editable With Design Mode

Modern browsers support a Web API called _Design Mode_. When you turn on
_Design Mode_, you are able to edit the text on the web page like you would do
in Word or Dreamweaver. This is a great way to experiment with copy.

By default it is `"off"`, but you can turn it on from your browser's devtools
console.

```
> document.designMode = "on"
"on"
```
