# Show Description Of All npm Config Options

In [Open Global npm Config File](open-global-npm-config-file.md), I showed how
you can access and modify the current npm config. The thing that stands out in
that file is the sheer number of config options.

What do they all mean?

To get "more than you probably want to know about npm configuration", open up
the npm config help with the following command:

```bash
$ npm help 7 config
```

There are a ton, so browse at your own peril. You'll notice that each option
lists its default value, the type of that value, and a description about usage.
