# List The Running Ruby Version

The running Ruby version can be listed with the `RUBY_VERSION` constant.

For instance, if my Ruby version is 3.0.0, then I could get the version like
so:

```ruby
> RUBY_VERSION
=> "3.0.0"
```

This is nice if you just want to check in an IRB session or if you need it as
part of a script.
