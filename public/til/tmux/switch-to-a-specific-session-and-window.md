# Switch To A Specific Session And Window

Hitting `ctrl-<prefix> w`, similar to `ctrl-<prefix> s`, will open up a pane
for switching sessions. However, this one will display each window as an option
below each session.

When just switching sessions, you are taken to the last active window. With
`ctrl-<prefix> w`, you can choose not just the session you want to switch to,
but a specific window within that session.
