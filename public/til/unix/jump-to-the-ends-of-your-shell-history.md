# Jump To The Ends Of Your Shell History

There are all sorts of ways to do things in your shell environment without
reaching for the arrow keys. For instance, if you want to move _up_ to the
previous command, you can hit `Ctrl-p`. To move _down_ to the next
command in your shell history, you can hit `Ctrl-n`.

But what if you want to move to the beginning and end of your entire shell
history?

Find your meta key (probably the one labeled `alt`) and hit `META-<` and
`META->` to move to the end and beginning of your shell history,
respectively.
