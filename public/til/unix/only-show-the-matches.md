# Only Show The Matches

Tools like `grep`, `ack`, and `ag` make it easy to search for lines in a
file that contain certain text and patterns. They all come with the `-o`
flag which tells them to only show the part that matches.

This is particularly powerful when used with regex and piped into other
programs.
