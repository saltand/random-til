# Cat Files With Color Using Bat

The time-tested utility `cat` is probably one of the most used unix
commands. It prints the contents of the file to stdout. You can use it to
get a quick view of a file.

We live in a world of color and our terminal emulators are capable of so
much more. There is an alternative to `cat`, called `bat`, that provides
syntax highlighting based on the type of file.

This is an open-source utility written in Rust. You can check it out on
