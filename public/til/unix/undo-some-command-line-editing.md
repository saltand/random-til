# Undo Some Command Line Editing

When using some of the fancy command line editing shortcuts, such as
`ctrl-u`, you may end up erroneously changing or deleting part of the
current command. Retyping it may be a pain or impossible if you've forgotten
exactly what was changed. Fortunately, bash's command line editing has undo
built in. Just hit `ctrl-_` a couple times to get back to where you want to
be.
