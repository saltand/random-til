# Search Man Page Descriptions

You can use the `apropos` command with a keyword argument to search for that
words occurrence throughout all the man pages on your system. For instance,
invoking `apropos whatis` will bring up a list of entries including the
`apropos` command itself.

See `man apropos` for more details.
