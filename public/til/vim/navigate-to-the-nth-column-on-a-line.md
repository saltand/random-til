# Navigate To The Nth Column On A Line

You can navigate the cursor to a specific column of the current line using
the `|` character. For instance typing

```
45|
```

will navigate your cursor to the 45th column of the current line. If you
type a number that exceeds the number of columns on the line, your cursor
will be placed on the last column.

Here is what the help files have to say about `|`:

```
|			To screen column [count] in the current line.
			|exclusive| motion.  Ceci n'est pas une pipe.
```
