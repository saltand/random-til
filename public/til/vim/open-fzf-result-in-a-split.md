# Open FZF Result In A Split

The [`fzf.vim` plugin](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) allows you to do
speedy fuzzy searches for filenames and line-by-line content.

Once you've narrowed down the results and found what you're interested in,
you can hit `<enter>` and a new buffer will open over what was already in
the window. You can also open that file as a split.

Hitting `Ctrl-x` will open the file under the cursor as a horizontal split.

Hitting `Ctrl-v` will alternatively open that file as a vertical split.
