# Using vim-surround With A Visual Selection

The [`vim-surround`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) plugin allows
you to do a variety of actions that have to do with the surrounding
characters of text objects.

The `S` keystroke allows you to surround a visual selection with the
following character.

First, make a visual selection. Then hit `S`. Then hit a surround character
such as `(` or `[` and the area of text that has been visually selected will
be wrapped with the respective surround characters.
