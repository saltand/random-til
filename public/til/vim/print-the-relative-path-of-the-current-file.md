# Print The Relative Path Of The Current File

As a project grows and there are many directories and long path names, Vim
will not always have enough room to display the full relative path of the
current file. It may have to cut off the initial directories which can make
it hard to know where you are.

You can hit `Ctrl-g` to quickly display the relative path of the current
file below the status bar.

See `:help Ctrl-g` for more details.
