# Normal Mode Binding To Just Quit

I'm already familiar with the normal mode binding to write and quit -- `ZZ`.
It turns out there is an equivalent binding to quit without writing. Hit
`ZQ` and Vim will quit the current window disregarding any unsaved changes.
This behaves in the same way as if you had executed the `:q!` command.

See `:help ZQ`.
