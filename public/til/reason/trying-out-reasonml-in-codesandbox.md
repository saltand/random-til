# Trying Out ReasonML In CodeSandbox

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) recently added support for a bunch of
new technologies.  Among these is [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/).

To give ReasonML a try, visit this [template
link](https://codesandbox.io/s/reason).

This is a [`reason-react`](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)
template which allows you to write a React web app using ReasonML.
