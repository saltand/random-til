# Zero-Config Environments For Trying Out Types

I've found a few zero-config environments for trying out TypeScript. These are
environments where you can write out type definitions, use them in code, and
see type errors as they arise. These are great if you are following along with
an article as opposed to working with an existing project.

1. [The TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)

This is the quickest environment to jump into. Though TS settings can be
configured, it is just a playground. It is to grab a link to share.

2. [Codesandbox's ts.new](https://ts.new)

This URL shortcut will spin up a brand-new Vanilla TypeScript codesandbox
project. This is a more full-fledged development environment for a TypeScript
project, though still in the bowser. It is also easy to share, and you can
download/export the code.

3. [TSDX](https://tsdx.io/)

This is a zero-config CLI for generating a TypeScript project for package
development. It can generate Vanilla and React TypeScript projects. This lets
you develop on your machine, rather than in a browser.  You'll now need to push
the code to somewhere like GitHub to share it.
