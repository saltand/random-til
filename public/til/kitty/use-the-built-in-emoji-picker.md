# Use The Built-In Emoji Picker

Kitty has a built-in emoji picker which you can use to search for and select an
emoji character to be placed in your current terminal context. This is handy
because Mac OSX's built-in emoji picker (Ctrl-Cmd-Space) doesn't work in Kitty.

To open up Kitty's emoji picker, hit `Ctrl-Shift-u` (or prefix `u` with
whatever your Kitty metakey is). You'll see a full screen menu with 4 different
tabs. If you move to the _Emoji (F2)_ tab (`Ctrl-]` and `Ctrl-[` to navigate),
you'll be able to search for an emoji based on its metadata name.

For instance, if I type `check`, I'll see a bunch of unicode characters that
match that term including `3  âœ… White heavy check mark`. By hitting tab until
I reach that result, I can hit `Enter` to send that emoji to the terminal
context.
