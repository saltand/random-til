# Turn Off Display Of Tabs For Files

Each time a file is opened in VS Code, it appears as one of many toward the top
of the window right above the text editor area. It shows the name of the file
and the 'dirty' status. Over time as more and more files are opened and edited,
the tabs accumulate and can only be viewed by horizontally scrolling left and
right.

There are other ways to navigate to files besides selecting tabs of already
opened files. So, if you'd like to reclaim some screen real estate and reduce
the visual clutter of the tabs, you can turn them off.

Hit `Cmd+Shift+P`, then search for and go to _Preferences: Open Settings (UI)_.
Search for _Show Tabs_ which will show up under _Workbench > Editor_.

The default is _Multiple_. You can switch it to _None_ to completely hide tabs.
You can also set it to _Single_ which will display file name and path for the
current file, but eliminate the clutter of all other tabs.
