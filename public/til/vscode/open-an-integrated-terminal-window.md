# Open An Integrated Terminal Window

Visual Studio's Code editor offers an integrated terminal that can be used
for any of your bash needs -- tests, various git commands, etc.

You can toggle the integrated terminal window open and closed with

```
Ctrl+`
```

The shell session will be opened to the working directory of your current
project.
