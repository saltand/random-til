# Jump To Problems In The Current File

VSCode has a system for different extensions to report problems. The editor
will visually flag those problems in the editor with a red squiggly underline.
It will also list them in the _Problems_ tab of the bottom tray (hit `Cmd+j` to
pop that tray open).

If there are some active problems in your current file, you can jump right to
them.

Hit `F8` and you'll jump to the next problem after wherever the cursor is. Hit
`F8` again and it will go to the next one.

Want to track back through the file? Hit `Shift+F8` and you'll jump to the
closest problem _behind_ the current cursor position.

Using these two, you can quickly survey the current problems in your file
before deciding how to proceed.
