# Chrome Supports Many Unix Keyboard Shortcuts

In a Unix environment, you can use keyboard shortcuts to do a variety of things
more efficiently. For instance, hitting `ctrl-a` moves the cursor to the
beginning of the line. Conversely, `ctrl-e` moves the cursor to the end of the
line. Another fun one is `ctrl-u` which erases from the cursor to the beginning
of the line.

Learning these doesn't only have value when you are logged into some remote
server. There are many apps that support a variety of these shortcuts. Chrome
is one of them.
