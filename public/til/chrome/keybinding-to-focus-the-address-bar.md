# Keybinding To Focus The Address Bar

The address bar (URL bar) in Chrome is versatile. You can enter both URLs and
search terms into it. If I want to enter a new search term, I generally have to
reach for my mouse, double click in the address bar, and then type in that
term.

Chrome has a keybinding that sends focus to the address bar, which cuts some of
those steps.

Hit `Cmd-L`.

You'll see that the address bar gets focus with the entire address highlighted.
You can begin typing your new search term immediately.
