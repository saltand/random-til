# Toggle Device Mode

Working on some styles? Want to make sure those minor tweaks look good on
both desktop and mobile? Your probably moving back and forth between the
desktop mode and one of the smaller device modes.

There is a keybinding for this -- `Cmd-Shift-M`

The chrome devtools panel will need to be open and in focus for this to
work.
