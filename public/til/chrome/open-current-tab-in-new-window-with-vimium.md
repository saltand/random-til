# Open Current Tab In New Window With Vimium

Sometime I have a busy Chrome window going with a bunch of tabs open for
various lines of work as well as a number of tabs that I've neglected to close.
I then open a new tab, find something useful, and realize I'm at a "branching
point". I'm about to start in on a specific chunk of work that will probably
involve opening several more tabs and switch back and forth between some
dashboards. I want to start all of this from a fresh slate -- or at least from
a fresh Chrome window.

With [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium), I can hit `W` (`Shift-w`) to
have the current tab move from the current window to a new window. The original
window, minus that one tab, will be left as is so that I can go back to it as
needed.
