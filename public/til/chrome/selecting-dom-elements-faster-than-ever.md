# Selecting DOM Elements Faster Than Ever

Selecting and inspecting DOM elements: you've done it many times before.
Whether you right click the element and select _Inspect_ (which isn't always
all that accurate) or you use the DevTools' inspect tool with
highlight-assist, it takes a couple clicks to get there.

There is a faster way.

Hit `Cmd-Shift-C`.

Chrome DevTools will be expanded open if it isn't already and your mouse
pointer will be put in inspect mode with the highlight-assist. Find your DOM
element, give it a click, and start inspecting!
