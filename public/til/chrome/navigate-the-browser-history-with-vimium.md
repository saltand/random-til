# Navigate The Browser History With Vimium

The [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) Chrome extension is great for moving
around the current page you are on. It can also be used to navigate back and
forth through your browser history.

You can go back to the previous page with `H` (`Shift-h`).

You can go forward to a page you went back from with `L` (`Shift-l`).
