# Easier Access To Network Throttling Controls

In [Simulating Various Network Connection
Speeds](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/chrome/simulating-various-connection-speeds.md),
I showed how to change between various simulated connection speeds from the
_Network_ tab in Chrome devtools. Unfortunately, the Connection Speed
dropdown is crowded out by a number of other controls in the _Network_ tab.
As a result, unless that tab is expanded pretty wide, you won't be able to
get at it. I've found myself sliding the devtools wider and narrower over
and over while testing things with throttling.

There is another, easier place to access throttling.

The console drawer gives us access to a number of additional tabs of
controls. Add the _Network connections_ tab for easier access.
