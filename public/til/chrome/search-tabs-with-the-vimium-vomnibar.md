# Search Tabs With The Vimium Vomnibar

If you use Chrome like I do, then you eventually end up with several windows
with dozens if not 100+ tabs open. It can start to get tedius with that many
tabs to find and navigate to a given tab. Someone might suggest closing a few
dozen tabs as a solution to this predicament. However, Vimium offers a solution
that doesn't require I [_kill my
darlings_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kill_one%27s_darlings).

The Vomnibar, a Vimium-powered search bar, can be summoned with `T` to only
search through open tabs.

When I hit `T`, I see a text area (for refining the search) and then a bunch of
entries populate below that which I immediately recognize as many of those tabs
that I'm going to get back to one of these days.

To narrow down to the specific thing I'm looking for, I type something into the
input. Then I arrow to the result I'm looking for and hit enter. And I'm
transported to that tab.

If I don't like where I ended up, I can also go back to the tab I had been on
with `^`.
