# Convert An HEIC Image File To JPG

I took a photo with my iPhone and then airdropped it to my Mac. This opened it
up in Preview. From there I could see that the extension on the file was HEIC.
I'm not familiar with that filetype and what I want is a JPG.

The Preview app (which is already open in this scenario) can handle this
conversion.

Go to _File_ > _Export..._

Change the _format_ from `HEIC` to `JPEG`.

Feel free to update the name and save location at this point as well.

Then hit _Save_ and Preview will perform the conversion.
