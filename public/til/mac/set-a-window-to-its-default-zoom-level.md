# Set A Window To Its Default Zoom Level

Often when showing my screen to someone else or connecting to a project, I
have to adjust the zoom level of my current window by hitting `Cmd +` a
bunch of times. Once I am done I usually do some guess work to get the
screen size back to what I am used to, hitting `Cmd -` a couple times.

There is an easier way.

Hitting `Cmd 0` will return the window back to its default zoom level.
