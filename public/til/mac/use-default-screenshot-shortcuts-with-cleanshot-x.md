# Use Default Screenshot Shortcuts With CleanShot X

accompanies this TIL to see how to do this visually._

On macOS there are a set of keyboard shortcuts for taking screenshots. The one
that I use most often is `Cmd-Shift-4`. It turns the cursor into cross hairs so
that I can make a drag selection of part of the screen to be captured as a
screenshot.

I've recently transitioned to using CleanShot X for taking screenshots. It
offers some improvements over the built-in screenshot tool, like annotations
and sticking recently screenshots in the corner of the window. As part of this
transition, I wanted `Cmd-Shift-4` to activate CleanShot X's _Capture Area_
feature instead of the built-in one.

To do this, first open up _System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts_. Then go
to the _Screenshots_ section and de-select any shortcuts that you want to
remap. For `Cmd-Shift-4`, that is "Save picture of selected area as a file".

Then I open _Preferences > Shortcuts_ for CleanShot X and map _Capture Area_ to
`Cmd-Shift-4`.

Hitting `Cmd-Shift-4` will now activate CleanShot X's Capture Area instead of
the one for the built-in screenshot app.
