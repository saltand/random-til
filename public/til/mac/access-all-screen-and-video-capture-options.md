# Access All Screen And Video Capture Options

There are a number of hotkeys to help you quickly capture a screenshot on the
Mac. If you aren't sure which is which or what options are available, you can
hit `Cmd+Shift+5`. This will open up a panel with the five main options. These
include Capture Entire Screen, Capture Selected Window, and Capture Selected
Portion for screenshots as well as Record Entire Screen and Record Selected
Portion for videos.
