# Gesture For Viewing All Windows Of Current App

When working on a web application, I often end up with a couple Chrome
windows open and sometimes even a couple terminal windows open. I generally
use the `Cmd+~` key binding to toggle through them. This can occasionally
get confusing though. To get the fuller picture, I can get a birds-eye view of all windows for
the current app using a track pad gesture.

Swiping down with three fingers on the track pad will provide a zoomed out
view of all windows. Click on the window you care about to view that or
swipe back up with three fingers to dismiss it.
