# View All Windows Of The Current App

In [Gesture For Viewing All Windows Of Current
App](gesture-for-viewing-all-windows-of-current-app.md), I showed off a
track pad gesture that allows you to view all window instances of the app
you are currently focused on.

There is an analog keyboard shortcut that allows you to do the same thing --
without dragging your hands away from the keys.

Tap `Ctrl+â†“` to do the same.
