# Access System Information OS X

On machines running OS X, there is an Apple icon in the upper left corner as
part of the menu bar. Clicking on this icon reveals a number of options. The
first reads _About This Mac_.

If you hold down the `option` key, however, that first option will instead
read _System information..._

Select that option to access the System Information panel which can tell you
details about your hardware, software, and network.
