# Access Unsupported Screen Resolutions With RDM

If you visit the _Display Settings_ for your Mac, you'll find that you only
have a handful of screen resolution options. For standard use, you'll get by
with these. If you need a specific, unsupported resolution you'll need help
from a 3rd party tool. There are many options out there.
[RDM](https://github.com/avibrazil/RDM) is a free and open-source option.

Once you have it installed and have given it _Accessibility_ permissions,
open the menu from your top toolbar and select the resolution you are
looking for.

I use RDM to adjust my screen resolution to 1280x720 for optimal
screencasting.
