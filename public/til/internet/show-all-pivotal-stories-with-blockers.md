# Show All Pivotal Stories With Blockers

Within the past year [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) added
a feature that allows you to mark stories with _blockers_. These are visual
indicators with a description that are used to show a particular story is
blocked, that is, it cannot be completed until something else is taken care
of.

In order to maintain the health of the project, it is good to triage these
blocked stories from time to time. The best way to identify all of the
blocked stories is to filter them into their own column.

Enter `is:blocked` into the search bar to show all of the blocked stories.
