# Check Your Public IP Address

If you visit [https://checkip.amazonaws.com/](https://checkip.amazonaws.com/),
a plain text page will render that displays your current public IP address.

Alternatively, you can `cURL` this endpoint from the command line:

```bash
$ curl https://checkip.amazonaws.com/
```

Either way, you'll get your IP address. Do with that what you will.
