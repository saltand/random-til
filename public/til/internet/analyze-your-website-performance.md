# Analyze Your Website Performance

The [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) tool from Google is a
great way to quickly get actionable insights about where to improve your
website and app's _Performance_, _Accessibility_, and _SEO_.

To see how your public site or app does, grab its URL and analyze it at
[PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).

It will take a minute to run on either Mobile or Desktop (make sure to check
both) and then will output four headline numbers (out of 100) for each of the
categories.

You can then dig in to each category to see what recommendations they make for
improving your score.

This can also be run directly from Chrome devtools which is useful if you want
to see how a locally running site is doing. You can run the analysis from the
_Lighthouse_ tab of devtools. Note: if the _Performance_ score looks bad, it
might be that you are running a non-optimized dev server that isn't reflective
of how your site would do in production.
