# Grab The RSS Feed For A Substack Blog

I've been attempting to put more energy into finding and reading blog posts via
an RSS feed reader. This as opposed to scrolling and scrolling and hoping that
the algorithm turns up an interesting article or two.

A lot of people who have been blogging for a while have a handy RSS feed link
prominently displayed on their site. We love to see it!

There are a few people whose writing I really enjoy that distribute their words
via Substack. I couldn't find a prominent or not prominent RSS feed link
anywhere on someone's Substack. What I did learn, after some searching, is that
you can tack `/feed` onto the end of someone's Substack URL and that will give
you the XML feed.

For example:

```
Substack blog landing page URL:
https://registerspill.thorstenball.com

Substack blog RSS feed URL:
https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/feed
```

Grab that feed URL and paste it into your feed reader and you should start
seeing their stuff show up.
