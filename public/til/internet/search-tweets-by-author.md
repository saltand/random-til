Twitter has some advanced search features that allow you to do more than
just search by keyword. The `from:<author>` syntax is the way that you can
restrict your search results to a specific twitter user.

By using `"pair programming" from:hashrocket`, I am able to find all of the
tweets by `@hashrocket` that use the exact phrase `pair programming`.
