# Get Random Images From Unsplash

_The below doesn't work on GitHub. It seems that GitHub caches and serves
its own version of the image. This will work anywhere where you aren't
caching images._

Here is an image from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com).

I don't know what image I am showing you though. That's because the URL
being sourced for the above image is
`http://source.unsplash.com/random/1200x600`. This tells unsplash to
randomly serve us a `1200x600` image. Try refreshing the page and you'll see
that it is different each time. Cool!

This is a bit of a novelty, but could be useful on occasion. The
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) docs use it to great effect in a
tutorial so as to not get caught up with the details of serving a specific
image.
