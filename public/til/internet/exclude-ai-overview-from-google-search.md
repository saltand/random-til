# Exclude AI Overview From Google Search

At the top of most Google searches these days is a section of text that takes a
moment to appear, presumably because it is being generated in the moment. This
is Google's _AI Overview_. These are sometimes useful summaries of the article
you are about to click on anyway. Other times the overview is no good, it takes
up a bunch of screen real estate, and may even [10x the energy consumed by a
regular
search](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1dsvefb/googles_ai_search_summaries_use_10x_more_energy/).

If you want to exclude the _AI Overview_, tack on a `-ai` when writing out your
search query.
