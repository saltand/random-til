# Enable Keyboard Shortcuts In Gmail

In these modern times of asynchronous communication and paperless receipts,
a person's email inbox can get mighty full. Keeping that influx of emails at
bay is a challenge. If you'd like to start unburying yourself and get on the
path to inbox zero -- Gmail's keyboard shortcuts can help.

Keyboard shortcuts are not enabled by default, so you'll need to turn them
on in settings. Click the _gear_ icon, select _Settings_ and then scroll
down under the _General_ tab until you find the _Keyboard shortcuts_
section. Select the _Keyboard shortcuts on_ radio button and then _Save
changes_.

You'll now have access to a variety of shortcuts, such as using the `j` and
`k` keys to move up and down the list of emails in your inbox. [Find the one
you want and hit `o` to open it
up](https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/41grpsmqzu-gmail-o-).

Keep exploring -- there is a whole world of keyboard shortcuts out there.
