# Prevent Search Engines From Indexing A Page

The `robots.txt` file is commonly used to tell (well-behaved) crawlers, such as
search engines, to not visit a page. If another page links to your page, it
will still be indexed. To instruct search engines to not index a given page,
robot meta tags need to be used.

To prevent indexing, add the following meta tag to the `<head>` section of any
relevant pages.

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```
