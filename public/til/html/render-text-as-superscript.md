# Render Text As Superscript

There is an [HTML
tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sup) that
tells browser engines to render text as superscript -- like when you need an
exponent.

```
<p>Render this text as <sup>superscript</sup>!</p>
```

Here is what the above would look like:

<p>Render this text as <sup>superscript</sup>!</p>

Check out this [codepen example](https://codepen.io/jbranchaud/pen/GzoyXe)
to play around with it.
